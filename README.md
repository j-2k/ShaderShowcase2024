# Shader Showcase 2024
**Unity BIRP - Version 2022.3.21f1 (LTS)  
THIS PROJECT WILL PROBABLY ONLY LAST FOR THE CURRENT YEAR ITS BEING WORKED ON (2024).**

*The yearly showcase project every year so this will probably be for the year of 2024 & again another new project will come in 2025... maybe.*  
*Link to previous shader showcase project here > [Shader Showcase 2023](https://github.com/j-2k/ShaderShowcase2023)*

I'll try to make this readme less messy this time since the last shadershowcase's readme was very messy, my bad!
