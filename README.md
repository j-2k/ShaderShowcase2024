# Shader Showcase 2024
**Unity BIRP - Version 2022.3.21f1 (LTS)  
THIS PROJECT WILL PROBABLY ONLY LAST FOR THE CURRENT YEAR ITS BEING WORKED ON (2024).**

*The yearly showcase project every year so this will probably be for the year of 2024 & again another new project will come in 2025... maybe.*  
*Link to previous shader showcase project here > [Shader Showcase 2023](https://github.com/j-2k/ShaderShowcase2023)*

I'll try to make this readme less messy this time since the last shadershowcase's readme was very messy, my bad!

## Jumping into Art Piece Ideas & Reference Images!
![EclipseScene](https://github.com/j-2k/ShaderShowcase2024/assets/52252068/0f7a8e9f-b78c-428d-9b96-c72eb2524df7)

This is the end of the readme the only thing below is my personal notes & cheatsheet where I post code that is commonly duplicated & used in many shader scripts mainly for myself but could be useful to you also!

# My Notes & Cheatsheet you can skip this!
### Credits & Learning resources at the end!
I will try commenting the code below in each section to help me understand what's going on for each section of the cheatsheet! Should be useful when revising certain topics & mainly just learning & understanding for myself.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: DONT FORGET YOUR VARIABLES IN THE V2F STRUCT & APP DATA STRUCT!!!**

---
### Get world position of the mesh's verticies!
```hlsl
//IN VERT SHADER:
o.worldPos = mul(unity_ObjectToWorld, v.vertex).xyz;
```
---
### UV Spherical Unwrapping!
```hlsl
//IN VERT SHADER:
o.worldPos = mul(unity_ObjectToWorld,v.vertex);

//IN FRAG SHADER:
float3 worldPos = normalize(i.worldPos);
float arcSineY = asin(worldPos.y)/(PI/2); //PI/2;
float arcTan2X = atan2(worldPos.x,worldPos.z)/TAU;
float2 skyUV = float2(arcTan2X,arcSineY);
```
---
### *DEPENDENT VIEW* Water Depth!
```hlsl
//IN FRAG SHADER:
//Get Linear Depth Value
float depth01 = tex2Dproj(_CameraDepthTexture, UNITY_PROJ_COORD(i.screenPos)).r;
//The operation above is the same as the bottom one! just showing to help understand why we use the proj function
//float depth01 = tex2D(_CameraDepthTexture, UNITY_PROJ_COORD(i.screenPosition.xy / i.screenPosition.w)).r;
float depthFromEyeLinear = LinearEyeDepth(depth01);
                
float depthDifference = depthFromEyeLinear - i.screenPos.w;
float depthFade = 1 - saturate(depthDifference/_DepthFadeDist);
```
---
### *INDEPENDENT VIEW* Water Depth!  
```hlsl
//IN FRAG SHADER:
//(I converted it to shader code, since im on BIRP, hope its correct lmfao (seems to be atleast...üò≥))
float3 viewVectorWorldSpace = -1 * (_WorldSpaceCameraPos.xyz - i.worldPos); //CARE THIS IS NOT NORMALIZED!!!
//float3 viewVectorViewSpace = normalize(UnityWorldSpaceViewDir(vertexWorldPos));

float3 vvws = (viewVectorWorldSpace/i.screenPos.w) * depthFromEyeLinear;
float3 worldSpaceScenePos = vvws + _WorldSpaceCameraPos.xyz;

float3 worldWaterPos = i.worldPos - worldSpaceScenePos;
float worldWaterSurfaceToBottomDepth = worldWaterPos.y * -1;
worldWaterSurfaceToBottomDepth = saturate(exp(worldWaterSurfaceToBottomDepth/_DepthFadeDist));

return worldWaterSurfaceToBottomDepth;
```

# OPTIMIZATION NOTES
- Adding & Multiplication operations in a shader can be done in one gpu cycle and is very optimal & fast in a shader. Try using it as much as possible and avoid subtracting & diving whenever you can!

***IMPORTANT NOTE: THE TEXTURE MEMORY COST IS IN KB & THIS IS THE FINAL TEXTURE CREATED BY THE >>> GAME ENGINE <<< THIS IS NOT THE SOURCE FILE SIZE OF THE TEXUTRE AFTER ITS BEEN EXPORTED TO PNG/TGA/ETC BY PHOTOSHOP/TEXTURE EDITOR OF CHOICE, AKA, THIS IS NOT THE SAME SIZE AS SEEN IN THE FILE EXPLORER!***  

**Whenever possible try to use compression if some artifacting is okay, (reduce texture memory [VRAM] where ever you can)**
<ul>
  <b>Compression Types starting from highest compressions to lowest/no compression!</b>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>DXT1 : Strongest compression & only uses RGB Texture Channels</li>
      <li>DXT5 : Maximum compression but uses all RGBA Texture Channels</li>
      <li>BC7 : Maximum compression but supports 3 (RGB) or 4 (RGBA) Texture Channels</li>
      <li>R : NO compression and supports 1 (R) Color Texture Channel</li>
      <li>RGB : NO compression and supports 3 (RGB) Color Texture Channel</li>
      <li>RGBA : NO compression and supports 4 (RGBA) Color Texture Channel</li>
    </ol>
